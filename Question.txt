1. Create 3 components: gamecontrol, odd and even. 2. The gamecontrol should have buttons to stop and pause the game. 3.When starting the game an event holding the increment number should get emitted each sec(ref- setInterval( )).4.The event should be listenable from outside the component. 5.Stop the game using stop button(clearInterval). 6. A new odd component should be created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for even component(on even no).7. Simply output odd- Number and Even - Number in the two components. 8. Style the element(e.g paragraph) holding your output text differnetly in both components.
